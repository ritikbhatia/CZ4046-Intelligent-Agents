# CZ4046: Intelligent Agents

**Nanyang Technological University (NTU), School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE)**

## Course Overview

Intelligent Agents represent a modern paradigm for developing sophisticated software applications and are a core focus within Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. When these agents coexist, interact, and cooperate, they form **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**.

This course is designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge required for the **design and implementation** of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. You will learn how to apply these concepts to tackle **large-scale, complex, and dynamic real-world problems**.

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)

Upon successful completion of this course, students shall be able to:

1.  **Describe** the various connotations of agent-based computation and articulate how the field integrates into the broader landscapes of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.
2.  **Identify** the typical challenges and problems associated with the development of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems.
3.  **Describe and debate** different methodologies and solutions for addressing problems related to intelligent agents and multi-agent systems.
4.  **Analyse** real-world problems (including novel ones) related to intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, and subsequently **propose and evaluate** effective mitigations and solutions.
